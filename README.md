# chat

Simple chat website (server) using websockets.

## WARNING:

    This code is trash.
    Do not use this in any type of education purposes.
    Only for an example of how to not code.
    That is why this exists.

    It's performance is good.
    But that doesn't make the code good.
    Really bad practices.
    All the code in a single file.

    Please do not copy my code if you don't need it.
    But feel free to do that anyways.
    This will run just fine with (I hope) no memory leaks.
    It has unhandled promise rejections which will throw errors in newer versions of NodeJS.

    This code is INTENTIONALLY BAD.
    You can fork it and make it better (not recommended for mental health).
    But please don't read all the code.
    That may damage your computer, eyes, brain cells and sanity.

#### An example of bad code:

```js
else { // why are you still reading this code
    // if you submit a pr to remove this code ill accept
    c.send("ERR_BROKE_QUANTUM");
    c.close();
    c.emit("close");
}
```
